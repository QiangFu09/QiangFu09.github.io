I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), where I am fortunately advised by [Andre Wibisono](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/wibisono/). Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. and M.S. in Math from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/). My research lies in the theory of optimization, statistics, and machine learning.
